# This is my first dotNet 6 web api project 

## Note: The project was done was using  C# .Net 6 framework

**_It is a CRUD project using C# .net 6 web api of bookstore management. It is a bookstore that allows the user to manage their book store, it allow them to register new books into the store, edit them and even delete them. It used SQL database to store all the information and I am still working on the frontend which will complete the whole thing._**
